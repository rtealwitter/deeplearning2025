    "text": "Course Description: Deep learning has revolutionized our ability to solve complex problems, but its success often obscures the underlying principles that make it work. This course offers a structured approach to understanding and applying deep learning techniques, beginning with the theoretical foundations of linear and logistic regression. We will then generalize these ideas into a three-step deep learning framework (architecture, loss function, and optimizer). Applying this framework, we will explore modern generative methods like auto-regressive language models and diffusion. Because the tools we discuss are so powerful, it is important to understand their limitations. To this end, we will also cover techniques for interpreting deep learning predictions and adding safeguards to generated content.\nPrerequisites: I will assume familiarity with calculus, linear regression, probability, and Python. In particular, I will assume you are comfortable with derivatives, the chain rule, gradients, matrix multiplication, and probability distributions.\nStructure: We will meet on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at 75 Shannon in Room 202. The lecture is from 10am to 12pm and the discussion is from 2 to 4pm. I will hold my office hours during the last hour of the discussion. If you would like to meet outside of these times, please email me.\nResources: This class is loosely based on Chinmay Hegde’s phenomenal graduate Deep Learning course at NYU Tandon. For each class, I will post my handwritten slides. I would also like for you to be able to access curated notes. To this end, one of the assignments in the class is to scribe notes on a lecture of your choice.\nDiscussion: Please post all your course related questions on Canvas. If your question reveals your solution to a homework problem, please email me instead.\n\nGrading\nYour grade in the class will be based on the number of points you earn. You will receive an A if you earn 93 or more points, an A- if you earn between 90 and 92 points (inclusive), a B+ if you earn between 87 and 89 points (inclusive), etc.\nParticipation and Questions (12 points): Since winter term classes are smaller, let’s take advantage of the opportunity for more engagement. Unless you have a reasonable excuse (e.g. sickness, family emergency), I expect you to attend every lecture and discussion. Whether you are able to attend or not, I expect you to fill out the form linked from the home page to receive credit for engagement (one point per lecture day that you fill it out). Of course, if you are not able to attend in person, you should watch the recorded zoom lecture before filling out the form.\nProblem Sets (48 points): There will be one problem per class. You may work on the problems with your classmates. However, you should write your solutions and code by yourself.\nProject (35 points): In order to practice implementing the ideas we cover, you will select a topic we cover in class and implement an algorithm we discussed on a data set of your choosing. You will write a report describing your results and what you learned. You will also give a presentation showcasing your code to the class. You can complete your project as an individual or with a partner.\nScribed Notes (9 points): Notes are a great resource for augmenting your in-class learning. While I have notes for the prior iteration of this course, I since updated the topics in this course to account for much of the progress in deep learning in the last two years. Unfortunately, I haven’t had time to create a new set of notes to reflect the current content. As such, I would like to ask for your help in writing these notes. I will provide an example for the first class (including the finished product and the source). Thereafter, students can sign up on this sheet to write notes for a lecture of your choice. You will have access to my handwritten slides, a zoom recording of the lecture, and any generative model. Because I hope to use these notes in future iterations of the course (with appropriate acknowledgements, of course), I will grade the notes stringently and allow you to resubmit them once.\nLate Policy: I expect all assignments to be turned in on time. If you are unable to turn in an assignment on time, you must email me before the assignment is due to request an extension.\n\n\nHonor Code\nAcademic integrity is an important part of your learning experience. You are welcome to use online material and discuss problems with others but you must explicitly acknowledge the outside resources on the work you submit.\nIf I notice that you have copied someone else’s work without proper attribution (such as code from the internet without a reference link or a solution very close to another student’s without giving credit), I will give you a warning. After the warning, I will subtract 5 points for every violation.\nLarge Language Models: LLMs (that we learn about in class!) are a powerful tool. However, while they are very good at producing human-like text, they have no inherent sense of ‘correctness’. You may use LLMs (as detailed below) but you are wholly responsible for the material you submit.\nYou may use LLMs for:\n\nImplementing short blocks of code that you can easily check.\nSimple questions whose answers you can easily verify.\n\nDo not use LLMS for:\n\nImplementing extensive code or code that you don’t understand.\nComplicated questions (like those on the problem sets) that you would learn from answering yourself.\n\nUltimately, the point of the assignments in this class are for you to practice the concepts. If you use an LLM in lieu of practice, then you deny yourself the chance to learn.\n\n\nAcademic Accommodations\nIf you have a Letter of Accommodation, please contact me as early in the term as possible. If you do not have a Letter of Accommodation and you believe you are eligible, please reach out to the ADA Coordinators at ada@middlebury.edu."

    "text": "Supervised Binary Classification\nAt times, we will build models with data whose output values are discrete rather than Linear. For these cases, it is not appropriate to use Linear Regression. Instead, these models will use an approach called Supervised Binary Classification. For these such models, imagine a dataset represented as:\n\\(\\mathcal{D} = \\{(x^i, y^i)\\}_{i=1}^n, \\; x^i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d, \\; y^i \\in \\{0, 1\\}\\)\nOur output value y, is represented as a binary value, either 1 for ‘True’ or 0 for ‘False’.\nOur end goal for this method is for our Model’s predicted output \\(F(x) = \\text{Output}\\) to equal the predicted probability of a possitive class (binary value 1). This allows us to later optimize the model by using optimizers which reward correct and confident results, while indicating a high level of loss for confident and incorrect results.\n\nSigmoid Function\nIn the context of logistic regression, the sigmoid function is a mathematical function used to map real-valued inputs into a probability range between 0 and 1. It is defined as:\n\\(\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\\)\nThe sigmoid function ensures the output of logistic regression is bounded between 0 and 1, making it suitable for probabilistic interpretation.\n\n\n\nLogistic Sigmoid Graph\n\n\nCompared to Linear Regression, Logistic Regression Models use this sigmoid as an activation function to ensure output of a probability in the range [0,1].\n\n\n\nActivation application"

    "text": "General Classification Model\nWhen dealing with k &gt; 2 classes, we need to output a probability distribution over all possible classes. This requires:\nMultiple neurons: Each class gets its own weight vector \\(w_i\\) to compute class-specific scores Softmax activation: Converts raw scores into proper probabilities that sum to 1.\nFor input x, the model computes: \\(z_i = w_i^T x + b_i\\) for i = 1,…,k \\(f_i(x) = \\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^k e^{z_j}}\\) The softmax function ensures:\nAll outputs are positive (due to exponential) Outputs sum to 1 (due to normalization) Preserves ordering of inputs (monotonic)\nApplication of softmax equation:\n\n\nCross Entropy Loss\nCross entropy provides a natural way to compare the predicted probability distribution with the true distribution encoded as one-hot vectors. For a single example with true class j: \\(H(y, f(x)) = -\\sum_{i=1}^k y_i \\log(f_i(x)) = -\\log(f_j(x))\\) This loss function has important properties:\nSimplifies to negative log probability of true class (since y is one-hot) Goes to infinity as predicted probability approaches 0, strongly penalizing confident wrong predictions Matches information theoretic notion of coding length Proper scoring rule (minimized by true probabilities).\n\n\n\nNegative Log graph\n\n\nThe negative log function’s shape explains these properties:\nSteep slope near 0 → large gradients for wrong predictions.\nShallow slope near 1 → small gradients for correct predictions.\nAsymptote at 0 → infinite loss for completely wrong predictions.\n\n\nbinary encoding and entropy\nIn these logistic deep learning models, discrete information must be given to the model by encoding categories using bit integer values. For example, assigning A,B,C,D to 00,01,10,11 is an example of fixed-length encoding. This is straightforward and works well when all labels are equally likely to occur. However, if the symbols are not equally likely, this approach is inefficient because it doesn’t take advantage of the differing probabilities.\nWhen the probability distribution of symbols is known, variable-length encoding becomes more efficient. The idea is to assign:\n-Shorter codes to more common symbols. -Longer codes to less common symbols.\nThis minimizes the expected number of bits required to encode a sequence of symbols, leading to more efficient storage or communication.\nBelow are examples of fixed length encoding vs variable-length encoding for a distribution with many C’s, some A’s, and less B and D’s:\n \nShannon’s entropy formula quantifies the minimum average number of bits required to encode symbols from a probability distribution:\n\\(H(q) = -\\sum_{i} p_i \\log_2(p_i)\\)\nIn order to find the entropy loss between two different distributions p and q:\n\\(H(p,q) = -\\sum_{i} p_i \\log_2(q_i)\\)"

    "text": "Conclusion\nWe now have model of outputting predictions for classification and a loss. Logistic regression represents a fundamental approach to binary classification problems, distinct from linear regression by its ability to handle discrete outputs through probability estimation.\nExact computation won’t work like it did for linear regression, so we need a new strategy for this kind of problem.\nThe sigmoid function serves as the crucial bridge, transforming linear combinations of inputs into probabilities between 0 and 1, making it ideal for binary classification tasks.\nCross entropy loss plays a vital role in measuring model performance, providing a mathematically sound way to quantify the difference between predicted probabilities and actual binary labels. Its properties make it particularly effective for gradient descent optimization, as it heavily penalizes confident but incorrect predictions while rewarding accurate ones.\nThe connection to information theory through binary encoding and entropy demonstrates the broader theoretical foundation of these concepts. Whether using fixed-length or variable-length encoding, the choice of representation impacts the efficiency of information storage and processing. Shannon’s entropy formulas provide a mathematical framework for quantifying these efficiencies and measuring the divergence between probability distributions."

    "text": "When I first heard about machine learning, I imagined a computer that was rewarded every time it gave the right answer. Maybe there were electric carrots and sticks that no one had bothered to tell me about? While I now know as little as I did then about computer hardware, I have learned that machine learning is fundamentally a mathematical process.\nLuckily, we’ve been learning about the very mathematical ideas that make machine learning work for years! We’ll review the basics of these concepts and then jump in to linear regression, arguably the foundation of neural networks.\n\n\nImagine a function \\(\\mathcal{L}: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\). (Instead of the usual \\(f\\), we’ll use \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) for reasons that will soon become clear.) The mapping notation means that \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) takes a single real number as input and outputs a single real number. In general, mathematicians tell us to be careful about whether we can differentiate a function. But, we’re computer scientists so we’ll risk it for the biscuit.\nLet \\(z \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) be the input to \\(\\mathcal{L}\\). The derivative of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) with respect to its input \\(z\\) is mathematically denoted by \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}[\\mathcal{L}(z)]\\).\nFormally, the derivative is defined as \\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}[\\mathcal{L}(z)]\n= \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{\\mathcal{L}(z + h) - \\mathcal{L}(z)}{h}.\n\\] If we were to plot \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), the derivative at a point \\(z\\) would be the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point.\nHere are several examples of functions and their derivatives that you might remember from calculus.\n\n\n\nFunction: \\(\\mathcal{L}(z)\\) \n\n\nDerivative: \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}[\\mathcal{L}(z)]\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\[z^2\\]\n\n\n\\[2z\\]\n\n\n\n\n\\[z^a\\]\n\n\n\\[a z^{a-1}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\\[az + b\\]\n\n\n\\[a\\]\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\ln(z)\\]\n\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{z}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\\[e^z\\]\n\n\n\\[e^z\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile working with a simple basic function is easy, we’re not always so lucky. Modern machine learning chains many many complicated functions together. Fortunately, we will think of these operations modularly.\nLet \\(g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) be another function. Consider the composite function \\(g(\\mathcal{L}(z))\\).\nBy the chain rule, the derivative of \\(g(\\mathcal{L}(z))\\) with respect to \\(z\\) is \\[\n\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial z}[g(\\mathcal{L}(z))]\n= \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z}(\\mathcal{L}(z))\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}[\\mathcal{L}(z)].\n\\]\nOften, we will also multiply functions together. The product rule tells us that \\[\n\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial z}[g(z) \\mathcal{L}(z)]\n= g(z) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}[\\mathcal{L}(z)]\n+ \\mathcal{L}(z) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}[g(z)].\n\\]\n\n\n\nIn machine learning, we process high-dimensional data so we are interested in functions with multivariate input. Consider \\(\\mathcal{L}: \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}\\). The output of the function is still a real number but the input consists of \\(d\\) real numbers. We will use the vector \\(\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\) to represent all \\(d\\) inputs \\(z_1, \\ldots, z_d\\).\nInstead of the derivative, we will talk use the partial derivative. The partial derivative with respect to \\(z_i\\) is denoted by \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_i}[\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{z})]\\). In effect, the partial derivative tells us how \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) changes when we change \\(z_i\\) while keeping all other inputs fixed.\nThe gradient stores all the partial derivatives in a vector. The \\(i\\)th entry of this vector is given by the partial derivative of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) with respect to \\(z_i\\). In mathematical notation, \\[\n\\nabla_\\mathbf{z} \\mathcal{L} = \\left[\\begin{smallmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_1}[\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{z})] \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_d}[\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{z})] \\\\ \\end{smallmatrix}\\right]\n\\]\nJust like the derivative in one dimension, the gradient contains information about the slope of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) with respect to each of the \\(d\\) dimensions in its input.\n\n\n\nVector and matrix multiplication lives at the heart of deep learning. In fact, deep learning really started to take off when researchers realized that the Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) could be used to perform gradient updates in addition to the matrix multiplication it was designed to do for gaming.\nConsider two vectors \\(\\mathbf{u} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\). We will use \\(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\sum_{i=1}^d u_i v_i\\) to denote the inner product of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). The \\(\\mathcal{\\ell}_2\\)-norm of \\(v\\) is given by \\(\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_2 = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}}\\).\nConsider two matrices: \\(\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times m}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}\\) where \\(d \\neq n\\). We can only multiply two matrices when their inner dimension agrees. Because the number of columns in \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is the same as the number of rows in \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), we can compute \\(\\mathbf{AB}\\). However, because the number of columns in \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is not the same as the number of rows in \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), the product \\(\\mathbf{BA}\\) is not defined.\nWhen we can multiply two matrices, the \\((i,j)\\) entry in \\(\\mathbf{AB}\\) is given by the inner product between the \\(i\\)th row of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and the \\(j\\)th column of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). The resulting dimensions of the matrix product will be the number of rows in \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) by the number of columns in \\(\\mathbf{B}\\).\n\n\n\nIf we have a scalar equation \\(ax = b\\), we can simply solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by \\(a\\). In effect, we are applying the inverse of \\(a\\) to \\(a\\) i.e., \\(\\frac1{a} a =1\\). The same principle applies to matrices. The \\(n \\times n\\) identity matrix generalizes the scalar identity \\(1\\). This identity matrix is denoted by \\(\\mathbf{I}_{n \\times n} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}\\): the on-diagonal entries \\((i,i)\\) are 1 while the off-diagonal entries \\((i,j)\\) for \\(i\\neq j\\) are 0.\nConsider the matrix equation \\(\\mathbf{Ax} = \\mathbf{b}\\) where \\(\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}\\), \\(\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\), and \\(\\mathbf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\).

    "text": "When I first heard about machine learning, I imagined a computer that was rewarded every time it gave the right answer. Maybe there were electric carrots and sticks that no one had bothered to tell me about? While I now know as little as I did then about computer hardware, I have learned that machine learning is fundamentally a mathematical process.\nLuckily, we’ve been learning about the very mathematical ideas that make machine learning work for years! We’ll review the basics of these concepts and then jump in to linear regression, arguably the foundation of neural networks.\n\n\nImagine a function \\(\\mathcal{L}: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\). (Instead of the usual \\(f\\), we’ll use \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) for reasons that will soon become clear.) The mapping notation means that \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) takes a single real number as input and outputs a single real number. In general, mathematicians tell us to be careful about whether we can differentiate a function. But, we’re computer scientists so we’ll risk it for the biscuit.\nLet \\(z \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) be the input to \\(\\mathcal{L}\\). The derivative of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) with respect to its input \\(z\\) is mathematically denoted by \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}[\\mathcal{L}(z)]\\).\nFormally, the derivative is defined as \\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}[\\mathcal{L}(z)]\n= \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{\\mathcal{L}(z + h) - \\mathcal{L}(z)}{h}.\n\\] If we were to plot \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), the derivative at a point \\(z\\) would be the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point.\nHere are several examples of functions and their derivatives that you might remember from calculus.\n\n\n\nFunction: \\(\\mathcal{L}(z)\\) \n\n\nDerivative: \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}[\\mathcal{L}(z)]\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\[z^2\\]\n\n\n\\[2z\\]\n\n\n\n\n\\[z^a\\]\n\n\n\\[a z^{a-1}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\\[az + b\\]\n\n\n\\[a\\]\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\ln(z)\\]\n\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{z}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\\[e^z\\]\n\n\n\\[e^z\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile working with a simple basic function is easy, we’re not always so lucky. Modern machine learning chains many many complicated functions together. Fortunately, we will think of these operations modularly.\nLet \\(g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) be another function. Consider the composite function \\(g(\\mathcal{L}(z))\\).\nBy the chain rule, the derivative of \\(g(\\mathcal{L}(z))\\) with respect to \\(z\\) is \\[\n\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial z}[g(\\mathcal{L}(z))]\n= \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z}(\\mathcal{L}(z))\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}[\\mathcal{L}(z)].\n\\]\nOften, we will also multiply functions together. The product rule tells us that \\[\n\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial z}[g(z) \\mathcal{L}(z)]\n= g(z) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}[\\mathcal{L}(z)]\n+ \\mathcal{L}(z) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}[g(z)].\n\\]\n\n\n\nIn machine learning, we process high-dimensional data so we are interested in functions with multivariate input. Consider \\(\\mathcal{L}: \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}\\). The output of the function is still a real number but the input consists of \\(d\\) real numbers. We will use the vector \\(\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\) to represent all \\(d\\) inputs \\(z_1, \\ldots, z_d\\).\nInstead of the derivative, we will talk use the partial derivative. The partial derivative with respect to \\(z_i\\) is denoted by \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_i}[\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{z})]\\). In effect, the partial derivative tells us how \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) changes when we change \\(z_i\\) while keeping all other inputs fixed.\nThe gradient stores all the partial derivatives in a vector. The \\(i\\)th entry of this vector is given by the partial derivative of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) with respect to \\(z_i\\). In mathematical notation, \\[\n\\nabla_\\mathbf{z} \\mathcal{L} = \\left[\\begin{smallmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_1}[\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{z})] \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_d}[\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{z})] \\\\ \\end{smallmatrix}\\right]\n\\]\nJust like the derivative in one dimension, the gradient contains information about the slope of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) with respect to each of the \\(d\\) dimensions in its input.\n\n\n\nVector and matrix multiplication lives at the heart of deep learning. In fact, deep learning really started to take off when researchers realized that the Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) could be used to perform gradient updates in addition to the matrix multiplication it was designed to do for gaming.\nConsider two vectors \\(\\mathbf{u} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\). We will use \\(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\sum_{i=1}^d u_i v_i\\) to denote the inner product of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). The \\(\\mathcal{\\ell}_2\\)-norm of \\(v\\) is given by \\(\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_2 = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}}\\).\nConsider two matrices: \\(\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times m}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}\\) where \\(d \\neq n\\). We can only multiply two matrices when their inner dimension agrees. Because the number of columns in \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is the same as the number of rows in \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), we can compute \\(\\mathbf{AB}\\). However, because the number of columns in \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is not the same as the number of rows in \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), the product \\(\\mathbf{BA}\\) is not defined.\nWhen we can multiply two matrices, the \\((i,j)\\) entry in \\(\\mathbf{AB}\\) is given by the inner product between the \\(i\\)th row of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and the \\(j\\)th column of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). The resulting dimensions of the matrix product will be the number of rows in \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) by the number of columns in \\(\\mathbf{B}\\).\n\n\n\nIf we have a scalar equation \\(ax = b\\), we can simply solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by \\(a\\). In effect, we are applying the inverse of \\(a\\) to \\(a\\) i.e., \\(\\frac1{a} a =1\\). The same principle applies to matrices. The \\(n \\times n\\) identity matrix generalizes the scalar identity \\(1\\). This identity matrix is denoted by \\(\\mathbf{I}_{n \\times n} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}\\): the on-diagonal entries \\((i,i)\\) are 1 while the off-diagonal entries \\((i,j)\\) for \\(i\\neq j\\) are 0.\nConsider the matrix equation \\(\\mathbf{Ax} = \\mathbf{b}\\) where \\(\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}\\), \\(\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\), and \\(\\mathbf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\).

    "text": "Univariate Linear Regression\nNow that we’ve reviewed the basic building blocks of machine learning, we can dive into linear regression. Linear regression is a simple and powerful tool that we will use to understand the basics of deep learning.\n\nGoal\nWe will begin our study of deep learning in the supervised setting. In this setting, we are given labelled data with input features and an outcome. Formally, we will have \\(n\\) labelled observations \\((x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}), \\ldots, (x^{(n)}, y^{(n)})\\). In general, we will have \\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). For simplicity, we will assume for now that \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\).\nOur goal is to process the data and learn a function that approximates the outcomes. In mathematical notation, we want to learn a function \\(f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) so that \\(f(x^{(i)}) \\approx y^{(i)}\\) for the \\(n\\) labelled observations \\(i \\in \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\\).\nBefore we dive into the specific way we will accomplish this with linear regression, let’s discuss the general deep learning framework. This three-step framework gives a flexible scaffolding that we will use to understand almost every topic in this course.\nThe three-step framework includes:\n• The Model: The function that we’ll use to process the input and produce a corresponding output.\n• The Loss: The function that measures the quality of the outputs from our model. (Without loss of generality, we will assume that lower is better.)\n• The Optimizer: The method of updating the model to improve the loss.\nWith these general concepts in mind, we’ll explore linear regression.\n\n\nLinear Model\nAs its name suggests, linear regression uses a linear model to process the input into an approximation of the output. Let \\(w \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) be a weight parameter. The linear model (for one-dimensional inputs) is given by \\(f(x) = wx\\).\nUnlike many deep learning models, we can visualize the linear model since it is given by a line. In the plot, we have the \\(n=10\\) data points plotted in 2 dimensions. There is one linear model \\(f(x) = 2x\\) that closely approximates the data and another linear model \\(f(x)=\\frac12 x\\) that does not approximate the data.\n\n\n\nOur goal is to learn how to find a linear model that fits the data well. Before we can do this though, we will need to define what it means for a model to “fit the data well”.\n\n\nMean Squared Error Loss\nOur goal for the loss function is to measure how closely the data fits the prediction made by our model. Intuitively, we should take the difference between the prediction and the true outcome \\(f(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)}\\).\nThe issue with this approach is that \\(f(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)}\\) can be small (negative) even when \\(f(x^{(i)}) \\neq y^{(i)}\\). A natural fix is to take the absolute value \\(|f(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}|\\). The benefit of the absolute value is that the loss is \\(0\\) if and only if \\(f(x^{(i)}) = y^{(i)}\\). However, the absolute value function is not differentiable, which is a property we’ll need for optimization. Instead, we use the squared loss:\n\\(\\mathcal{L}(w) = \\frac1{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (f(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2\\)\nHere, we use the mean squared error loss, which is the average squared difference between the prediction and the true output over the dataset. Unlike the absolute value function, the squared function is differentiable everywhere. In addition, the squared error penalizes predictions that are far from the true output even more.\n\n\n\nThe plot above compares the squared function to the absolute value function. While both are \\(0\\) if and only if their input is \\(0\\), the squared function is differentiable everywhere and penalizes large errors more.\n\n\nExact Optimization\nWe now have our model and loss function: the linear model and mean squared error loss. The question becomes how to update the weights of the model to minimize the loss. In particular, we want to find \\(w\\) that minimizes \\(\\mathcal{L}(w)\\). While the language we’re using is new, the problem is not. We’ve actually been studying how to do this since pre-calculus!\nThe squared loss is convex (a bowl facing up versus the downward facing cave of concave); see the plot above for a ‘proof’ by picture. In this case, we know there is only one minimum. Not only that but we can find the minimum by setting the derivative to \\(0\\)!\nAs such, our game plan is to set \\(\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial w}\\) to \\(0\\) and solve for \\(w\\). Recall that \\(f(x) = wx\\). We will use the linearity of the derivative, the chain rule, and the power rule to compute the derivative of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) with respect to \\(w\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w}[\\mathcal{L}(w)]\n= \\frac1{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w} [(f(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2]\n= \\frac1{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n 2(f(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w} [(f(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})]\n= \\frac1{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n 2(w x^{(i)} - y^{(i)}) x^{(i)}.\n\\]\nSetting the derivative to \\(0\\) and solving for \\(w\\), we get \\(\\frac2{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n w (x^{(i)})^2 = \\frac2{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n y^{(i)} x^{(i)}\\) and so \\[\nw = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n y^{(i)}}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x^{(i)})^2}.\n\\]\nThis is the exact solution to the univariate linear regression problem! We can now use this formula to find the best linear model for our data. But we’re not done with linear regression yet. We assumed that the input was one-dimensional; however, we often have high-dimensional data."
